 Nonparametric Analysis of UK Road Accidents

 This repo contains the code for the projec the project of the coures in Non Parametric statistics of Politecnico di Milano, taught by Prof Ieva and Vantini.

## Abstract:
This project contains a nonparametric analysis of the traffic accidents and casualties in the United Kingdom in the years from 2005 to 2022. We start by analysing the stakeholders, the first responders, in the form of both emergency services and law enforcement, and we try to provide meaningful information in order to improve their services.
We focus in particular on three distinct aspects:
• investing the factors that influence the severity of a collision;
• modeling the distribution of the number of collisions both in time and space; • predicting the daily number of accidents in a given district.
